# Week 2 Challenge: My Portfolio

## My Task

This week I was tasked to build my own portfolio.

This portfolio shows everything and anything I have learned so far both during the class and off the class. I have kept it simple so that it is easy for me to understand and review moving forward.

In this webpage, only the Pre-work and Week-1 is linked to an actual website which I worked on. The others are placeholders and names.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here were the acceptance criteria set forth which I believe I have achieved.

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
